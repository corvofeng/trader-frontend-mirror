## Website Structure Analysis

### Current Page Hierarchy
```
Home (/)
├── Trading Journal (/journal)
│   ├── Portfolio (?tab=portfolio)
│   ├── Trade Plans (?tab=trades)
│   ├── Trade History (?tab=history)

```

## Key Recommendations

### 1. High-Priority Pages Needing More Internal Links

#### **Portfolio Page** (`/journal?tab=portfolio`)
- **Current Status**: Primary landing page for authenticated users
- **Needs**: More contextual links to related features
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### **Trade Plans Page** (`/journal?tab=trades`)
- **Current Status**: Core functionality but isolated
- **Needs**: Better connection to history and analysis
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### **Options Trading Page** (`/options`)
- **Current Status**: Standalone page with limited connections
- **Needs**: Integration with main journal workflow
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 2. Anchor Text Variations

#### For Portfolio Links:
- Primary: "Portfolio Overview"
- Secondary: "View Portfolio", "Portfolio Dashboard"
- Contextual: "Check your holdings", "Portfolio performance"
- Action-oriented: "Analyze your portfolio", "Track investments"

#### For Trading Links:
- Primary: "Trade Plans", "Trading Journal"
- Secondary: "Create trade plan", "Manage trades"
- Contextual: "Plan your next trade", "Trading strategies"
- Action-oriented: "Start trading", "Execute trades"

#### For Analysis Links:
- Primary: "Performance Analysis"
- Secondary: "Trading analytics", "Performance metrics"
- Contextual: "Review your performance", "Analyze results"
- Action-oriented: "Improve your trading", "Optimize strategy"

### 3. URL Structure Best Practices

#### Current Structure (Good):
```
/journal?tab=portfolio    ✓ Clean, semantic
/journal?tab=trades      ✓ Consistent pattern
/options                 ✓ Simple, memorable
```

#### Recommendations:
- Keep current structure - it's SEO-friendly and user-friendly
- Consider adding anchors for deep linking: `/journal?tab=portfolio#holdings`
- Use consistent parameter naming across all tabs

### 4. Link Attributes Best Practices

#### Internal Links:
```jsx
<Link 
  to="/journal?tab=portfolio"
  title="View your complete portfolio performance and holdings"
  aria-label="Navigate to portfolio overview"
>
  Portfolio Overview
</Link>
```

#### External Links:
```jsx
<a 
  href="https://external-site.com"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  title="External resource (opens in new tab)"
>
  External Resource
</a>
```
